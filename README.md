# Pokemon Ruby

This project aims to build a very close recreation of the classic Pokemon game.
You will be able to select one Pokemon at the beginning of the game, and then
train it in battles with other random trainers. You will also be able to monitor
your Pokemon's stats to track your progress. When you feel ready, you can
challenge Gym Leader Brock, and if you defeat him, you win the game. üí™üèº
